// Relay publishes a product's RabbitMQ outbox: the rows its changes write in their own
// transactions, so "the change happened" and "the event exists" are one fact.
//
// The table has the columns seq (bigserial, the order rows are sent in), exchange, routing_key,
// type, message_id, subject_id and version (both nullable: the subjectId and version headers when
// set) and body (jsonb), and an insert trigger that NOTIFYs Channel:
//
//	CREATE FUNCTION event_outbox_notify() RETURNS trigger LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
//	BEGIN PERFORM pg_notify('firewall_events', ''); RETURN NULL; END $$;
//	CREATE TRIGGER event_outbox_notify AFTER INSERT ON event_outbox
//	  FOR EACH STATEMENT EXECUTE FUNCTION event_outbox_notify();
//
// Every replica runs a Relay, and one at a time holds the advisory lock Lock on a connection of
// its own; the others wait on that lock, so a standby takes over as soon as the holder's session
// ends. The holder LISTENs on Channel (a notification arrives at the inserting transaction's
// commit) and publishes every row in seq order with publisher confirms, then deletes the
// confirmed rows. It reads the table only when woken, once after taking the lock and once after
// each RabbitMQ reconnect: there's no polling; its one timer is a health ping on the idle
// connection. A RabbitMQ outage only delays events: they wait in the outbox and the relay retries
// the broker with backoff, publishing again whatever wasn't confirmed (delivery is at least once).
//
// A row whose transaction commits after a later seq's was sent goes out when its own commit wakes
// the relay: consumers order by each subject's version, not by arrival.
//
// A row the broker refuses for good (see RefusedError: its exchange is missing, the relay's user
// may not write to it, it has no routing key) is retried like an outage unless Parked is set, and
// then holds back every row after it. With Parked set, once the row's exchange has refused
// continuously for ParkAfter (no confirm to it, no quiet gap of more than twice the relay's
// longest backoff between refusals), the relay moves the row there instead, logs an error (the
// alert) and carries on with the rest; until then it waits and is retried, so a topology that's
// only late (an exchange or a permission yet to be applied) recovers by itself. Other failures
// still retry in order. Once one of an exchange's rows is parked, its next refused row (with the
// same reply code, nothing confirmed to it since) is parked at once, however long after. An
// ACCESS_REFUSED from a second exchange right after a row was parked for ACCESS_REFUSED, with
// nothing confirmed between, looks like the relay's user lost its permissions everywhere rather
// than one message's fault: that row waits, logged as an error, until its own exchange has
// refused for twice ParkAfter, and then is parked anyway. What the
// relay knows of refusals is in memory and starts again each time it takes the lock. Parked has
// the outbox's columns, seq kept, and the reason:
//
//	CREATE TABLE event_outbox_parked (
//	  seq bigint PRIMARY KEY, exchange text NOT NULL, routing_key text NOT NULL, type text NOT NULL,
//	  message_id text NOT NULL, subject_id text, version bigint, body jsonb NOT NULL,
//	  reason text NOT NULL, parked_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now());
//
// Once the topology or permissions are fixed, parked rows are replayed by inserting them into the
// outbox again (new seqs; the insert's NOTIFY wakes the relay) and deleting them from Parked. A
// permission mistake that outlasts the guard above parks every row it refuses, each with its
// error log; the same statement, for every exchange, brings them back:
//
//	WITH p AS (DELETE FROM event_outbox_parked WHERE exchange = $1 RETURNING *)
//	INSERT INTO event_outbox (exchange, routing_key, type, message_id, subject_id, version, body)
//	SELECT exchange, routing_key, type, message_id, subject_id, version, body FROM p ORDER BY seq;
