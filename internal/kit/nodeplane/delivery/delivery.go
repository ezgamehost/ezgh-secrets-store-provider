// Package delivery takes a change from its commit to a node's stream, lifted from databases-stack
// (9ff61c1, itself lb-stack's at b63684f; network-stack's managed-l4-lb-design.md, "How a change
// reaches a node"): the product's outbox relay publishes a Pointer to one of its shard queues, the
// pod consuming that shard (Dispatcher) hands the latest generation to the pods holding the scope's
// nodes (Bus, Presence), and the pointer settles when they've all acked. A scope is whatever a
// product's nodes belong to (a database, a cluster); a node is its instance. Every Redis key and
// channel starts with the product's Prefix, so two products can share nothing by accident.
