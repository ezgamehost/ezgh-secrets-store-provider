// [being built] Delegated calls (contracts/service-auth.md, "Delegated calls";
// contracts/identity-and-authz.md, "Delegated checks"). A receiver's auth "delegated" endpoint
// serves another product's call made for a customer: the caller's receiver-issued credential,
// bound to its namespace, and an X-Ezgh-Caller reference. Its handler is the public route's: on a
// delegated call, Authorize, AuthorizeProject(Only), AuthorizeMissing, Check and CheckBatch each
// ask org-api's delegated check (one call each, nothing reused), so the call is attributable and
// recorded as the customer's, invoked by the calling service. An edge builds its outbound
// reference with Delegation (from its CheckBatch), a receiver relaying with Delegate.

// prepareDelegated runs a delegated endpoint's checks, in order, before the handler: (1) the
// caller's service credential (401 unauthenticated; X-Internal-Token never authorizes a
// delegated route), (2) exactly one canonical X-Ezgh-Caller (400 invalid_caller_reference, a
// missing one too), (3) the credential's namespace is the reference's caller and has an entry in
// the manifest's delegation, whose origins name the reference's origin for a two-entry chain
// (403 delegation_forbidden, logged, with no org-api call); then (4) the organization is the
// reference's, the project the path's :projectId, and the body is read as on caller routes.
// None of these refusals is recorded.
